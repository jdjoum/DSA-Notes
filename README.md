## What is a Data Structure?

  A **data structure** is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different types of data structures are designed to suit different kinds of operations and performance requirements, making them fundamental to computer science and software development.

  <ins>Common Types of Data Structures</ins>
    
  1. Array:
  - Description: A collection of elements, typically of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
  - Example: `int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`
  - Use case: Good for accessing elements by index, such as in lists of numbers or objects.

  2. Linked List:
  - Description: A sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node.
  - Example:
    ```
    class Node {
      constructor(data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
      }
    }
    ```
  - Use case: Useful for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion operations, like in queues or stacks.

  3. Stack:
  - Description: A collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
  - Example: Imagine a stack of plates where the last one added is the first one to be removed.
  - Use case: Useful in recursion, undo operations, or browser history navigation.

  4. Queue:
  - Description: A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out -(FIFO) principle.
  - Example: A line of people waiting for service where the first person in line is served first.
  - Use case: Task scheduling or handling requests in order.

  5. Hash Map (Hash Table):
  - Description: A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique, and a hash function is used to compute an index in an array to store the value.
  - Example: { "name": "John", "age": 30 } in JSON or a dictionary in Python.
  - Use case: Efficient lookups by key, like storing user data by their ID.

  6. Tree:
  - Description: A hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes, where each node can have multiple children.
  - Example: A file system structure where directories can have subdirectories.
  - Use case: Searching and sorting algorithms, hierarchical data representation.

  7. Graph:
  - Description: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them, representing relationships between pairs of objects.
  - Example: Social networks where users are nodes and friendships are edges.
  - Use case: Modeling networks, paths, and connections like web pages and links.

  <ins>Why Data Structures Matter</ins>

  The choice of data structure affects the efficiency of algorithms. For instance, a linked list is more efficient for frequent insertions and deletions compared to an array, while an array is better for random access.

## What is an Algorithm?

  An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure or set of rules used to solve a specific problem or perform a task. It is a sequence of instructions that can be executed to produce a desired outcome. Algorithms are widely used in computer programming, mathematics, and everyday problem-solving.

  <ins>Examples of Algorithms:</ins>

  1. Binary Search Algorithm:
  - Problem: Find an element in a sorted array.
  - Algorithm:
    1. Start with the middle element of the array.
    2. If the middle element is the target, return its index.
    3. If the middle element is greater than the target, repeat the process on the left half of the array.
    4. If the middle element is smaller, repeat the process on the right half of the array.
    5. Continue this process until the element is found or the array is exhausted.
  - Use Case: Searching for a name in a sorted list of contacts.

  2. Bubble Sort Algorithm:
  - Problem: Sort an array of numbers in ascending order.
  - Algorithm:
    1. Start from the first element of the array.
    2. Compare the current element with the next element.
    3. If the current element is greater than the next, swap them.
    4. Move to the next pair and repeat.
    5. After each pass through the array, the largest element moves to the end.
    6. Continue until the array is sorted.
  - Use Case: Organizing a list of students' grades from lowest to highest.

  3. Euclidean Algorithm:
  - Problem: Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
  - Algorithm:
    1. Divide the larger number by the smaller one.
    2. Take the remainder and replace the larger number with it.
    3. Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.
    4. The non-zero divisor at that point is the GCD.
  - Use Case: Simplifying fractions.

  4. Dijkstra’s Algorithm:
  - Problem: Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
  - Algorithm:
    1. Set the starting node’s distance to zero and all other nodes' distances to infinity.
    2. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance.
    3. Update the distances of its neighboring nodes.
    4. Repeat the process until all nodes have been visited or the shortest path to the target node is found.
  - Use Case: Finding the shortest driving route between two cities on a map.

  These examples illustrate how algorithms are designed to solve specific problems efficiently. Each step in an algorithm is clearly defined to ensure it can be followed systematically.

  In short, DSA equips you with the skills to solve complex problems efficiently, crucial for both technical growth and career progression.

## Stacks

  <ins>Comprehensive Overview of the Stack Data Structure</ins>

  A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It's similar to a stack of plates—only the top plate can be removed, and new plates are added to the top.

  Key Concepts of a Stack

  1. Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
  2. Pop: Remove and return the element from the top of the stack.
  3. Peek (or Top): Retrieve the top element without removing it.
  4. IsEmpty: Check whether the stack is empty.
  5. Size: Return the number of elements in the stack.

  Stacks can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or dynamic data structures like lists in high-level programming languages.

  <ins>Applications of Stacks</ins>

  1. Function Call Management: Programming languages use stacks to manage function calls and local variables in recursive functions. Each call is pushed onto the call stack, and when the function returns, it's popped off the stack.
  2. Expression Evaluation and Syntax Parsing: Stacks are used to evaluate expressions, including converting infix expressions to postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) or prefix. Parsing expressions in compilers also relies on stacks.
  3. Undo Mechanism: In text editors, stacks store previous actions so that undoing them can be done in reverse order of their execution.
  4. Balanced Parentheses Problem: Stacks are commonly used to check whether parentheses in expressions are balanced.
  5. Browser History: The back/forward navigation buttons in browsers use stacks to manage visited web pages.

  <ins>Stack Operations in Python Example</ins>
  
  Consider a stack that holds integers:
  ```
  stack = []
  ```

  1. Push Operation: Adding an element to the top of the stack:
      ```
      stack.append(10)  # Stack: [10]
      stack.append(20)  # Stack: [10, 20]
      ```
  2. Pop Operation: Removing the top element from the stack:
      ```
      top_element = stack.pop()  # Removes 20; Stack: [10]
      ```
  3. Peek Operation: Retrieving the top element without removing it:
      ```
      top_element = stack[-1]  # Retrieves 10 without removing
      ```
  4. IsEmpty Operation: Checking if the stack is empty:
      ```
      is_empty = len(stack) == 0  # False, since the stack is not empty
      ```
  5. Size Operation: Checking the size of the stack:
      ```
      size = len(stack)  # 1, since there is one element (10)
      ```
  
  Python uses lists as dynamic arrays to implement a stack.

  <ins>Advantages of Stacks</ins>

  1. Simple to Implement: Stacks are relatively easy to implement and manage.
  2. Efficient Operations: Push and pop operations run in constant time, O(1).

  <ins>Disadvantages of Stacks</ins>

  1. Limited Access: Elements can only be accessed from the top, making it inefficient for accessing elements deep within the stack.
  2. Fixed Size (in Array Implementation): When implemented using arrays, stacks may run into size limitations unless a dynamic resizing mechanism is used.

  <ins>Stack Implementations</ins>

  1. Array-Based Stack: Easy to implement but requires predefined size or dynamic resizing.
  2. Linked List-Based Stack: More flexible since it can grow dynamically without needing a fixed size.

  <ins>Conclusion</ins>

  Stacks are essential for many computing problems, especially those that require managing data in a LIFO order. Their simplicity, coupled with efficiency in performing basic operations, makes them a fundamental tool in algorithms, system design, and software development.
